# Clario test app

Its a simple sign up page created as a test task. I decided not to use any of external libraries for creating forms/validation, rather I created my simple validation and input field. App is created with Vite+React. I used em units of measurements so this page is responsive to almost any screen size.
To start the app you need to run these commands:

- `pnpm install`
- `pnpm start`
